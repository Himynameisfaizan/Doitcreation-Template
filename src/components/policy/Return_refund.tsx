          <h3>The Return & Refund policies </h3>
          <p>
            At Do It Creation, we are dedicated to delivering high-quality
            digital products and services that align with your vision and
            expectations. Our team ensures every project — from concept to
            completion — is handled with professionalism, creativity, and care.
            However, as we deal exclusively in digital design and development
            services, certain limitations apply regarding returns and refunds.

            <h3> Return & Refund Eligibility</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              Due to the personalized and digital nature of our work:
              <br />– No refunds, replacements, or returns will be applicable
              once a project or service has been purchased, delivered, or
              transferred.
              <br />– Once work is started or initiated on any service —
              including logo design, packaging design, website design, app
              design, or development — no refund requests will be accepted under
              any circumstances.
              <br />– This applies to all projects handled through both online
              and offline channels.

            <h3> Delivery & Usage</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              All services are provided and delivered digitally. Once files or
              deliverables have been shared, they are considered delivered and
              consumed. Because digital files can be easily duplicated or
              distributed, refunds or returns are not possible once the work has
              begun or been delivered.

            <p>
              Do It Creation reserves the right to take strict action in cases
              of:

              <br />– Misrepresentation of work progress or deliverables
              <br />– Malicious intent to misuse company services or policies
