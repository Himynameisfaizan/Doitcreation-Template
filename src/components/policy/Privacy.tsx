              cookies while providing access to its Website and Services and
              consent to its continued use of the same. For the purpose of

              ensure that you do not repeatedly see the same ads but (if you are
              opt-out) they can also help us prevent you from seeing targeted

              after you opt-out, you may still continue to see ads, but they
              will no longer be tailored to your interests. Opting-out also does
              not remove Do it Creation cookies. They will remain on your
              computer, but we will not use the data connected to your cookie
              for our services. Please note that if you delete your cookies, you
              will need to opt-out again to avoid being served targeted ads in
